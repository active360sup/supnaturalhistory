      "contents": "\r\nJoin us as for a Thames Natural History Tour, as we explore the wonderful wildlife of the River Thames. The river was once biologically dead, all life extinguished by industrial pollution, but since the 1970s wildlife has been returning, and thriving. And we’re on a mission to find it.\r\nThe Thames is now home to more than 125 species of fish, which in turn support two species of seal, deep-diving cormorants, stealthy grey herons and more. Stand up paddleboarding allows us to enjoy a unique perspective of the river’s wildlife, immersing ourselves in nature.\r\nAs we paddle, you will also learn about the natural history and ecology of the Thames, and the issues that still threaten this iconic waterway.\r\nThames Natural History Tour - beginners\r\nClick here to open the booking system in a new tab!\r\n\r\n\r\nThames Natural History Tour - intermediate\r\nClick here to open the booking system in a new tab!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
